# Virus-friendly workout booking App:
Having been in isolation for quite a while, new and selective modules may be needed to help us regain some of our luxuries in society. My idea is to make an application that contains 2 actors: the user, and the administrator. 
Both actors will have login functions.
The administrator will be able to log in all his training equipment, with unique identifiers for every single module. He will also be able to set up schedules for time/space managements, E.g., setting a treadmill for max 30 min use and not double booking 2 “neighboring” treadmills at the same time.
The user will be able to book these modules for a specific time, setting up his training routine from home, knowing he will be able to use these modules in a sequence without them being double booked or having issues with maintaining the regulations set for public spacing.

<br>

# High:
1) As an administrator I want to be able to register all my equipment, as well as inserting specific information regarding user regulations, timetables, and safety information.
2) As a user I want to be able to book training modules for a specific period, because we want the gyms open again. 


# Medium:

3) As an administrator I want to be able to provide and register users who put up a subscription in my Gym because preventing unregistered users will be necessary. 
4) As a user I want to be able to receive tables, data, and statistics regarding my past trainings because it can help me get motivated and help me regulate training into a steady and progressive rhythm.


# Low:
5) As an administrator I want to have the ability to broadcast information incase of emergencies or change of policies.
6) As a user I want to be able to insert my training data after my period, E.g. running speed, sets and weights because all data can be used for future regulations.
